# SMP-Challenge-Plugins
Various Paper plugins that add simple and fun challenges to be played on a small Paper server in small groups

All plugins can be drag and dropped in the plugins folder, with most plugins requiring an opped player to start the challenge using a command. Included plugins and instructions to play are listed below



- BestFriendsForever

  All players must stick very close together otherwise everyone takes damage. */start* to start and */stop* to end

- GravityFlip

  Gravity will randomly flip in the world causing all players, entities, and even some blocks to start ascending randomly. Use */gravityflip <start/stop>* to (de)active this plugin

- MissingChunks

  When new chunks are generated, every other chunk will be completely missing. *Is functional, but very taxing on the server, in the future this plugin will either pre-generate chunks or find more efficient means*

- Randomizer

  Every drop in the game is completely random. Every 5 minutes, the loot dropped from every item will randomize again to keep gameplay fresh. No need for any commands, works right out of the box

- SharedInventory

  Syncs every player's inventory on the server. All players will be sharing the same exact inventory at all times. Can be started/stopped with */sharedinv <start/stop>*

- TeamDeath

  If one person dies, everyone dies. Players to join after the challenge is started will be automatically put into spectator mode so people can still watch and not grief any participants. Challenge can be started with */deathstart*. Running the command again will turn the challenge off
